# Fixing the Funnel: A/B Testing on Signup Flow for 20% Conversion Uplift

### üéØ Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end simulation of an A/B test designed to optimize a product's user signup funnel. It demonstrates key skills in conversion rate optimization (CRO), statistical analysis, and data-driven decision-making. The goal was to achieve a **20% conversion uplift** on the Visit-to-Signup rate by implementing a new signup flow.

### ‚ú® Key Features
- **Funnel Visualization**: A dashboard to track user drop-offs at each stage (Visit ‚Üí Signup ‚Üí Activation ‚Üí Retention) for both the Control and Variant groups.
- **Simulated A/B Test**: A realistic simulation of an A/B test with a defined hypothesis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: A Python script to calculate key metrics like p-value, confidence interval, and statistical significance.
- **Actionable Decision Framework**: A clear, data-driven framework to decide whether to "Roll-out," "Rollback," or "Iterate" based on the test results.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A clean, professional web-based dashboard built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Dashboard**: HTML5, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript
- **Statistical Analysis**: Python, SciPy, NumPy
- **Data Simulation**: Python/JavaScript
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

### üß™ Methodology
1.  **Baseline Funnel Analysis**: Defined the key funnel stages and established baseline conversion rates from simulated historical data.
2.  **Hypothesis Formulation**: Proposed a change (simplified form, new CTA) to increase the Visit-to-Signup conversion rate by 20%.
3.  **Experiment Simulation**: Simulated an A/B test with a Control group (A) and a Variant group (B).
4.  **Data Analysis**: Performed a statistical analysis on the simulated results using a Python script to determine significance.
5.  **Dashboarding**: Built an interactive dashboard to visualize the funnel drop-offs and display the A/B test results in a clear and concise manner.
6.  **Decision Making**: Utilized a predefined framework to make an informed decision based on the p-value and confidence interval.

### üìä How to Run the Project
1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/antonymondal50-hub/funnel-optimization-ab-testing.git](https://github.com/antonymondal50-hub/funnel-optimization-ab-testing.git)
    cd funnel-optimization-ab-testing
    ```
2.  **View the Dashboard**: Open `src/index.html` in your web browser to see the interactive dashboard.
3.  **Run the Statistical Analysis**: Navigate to the `analysis` folder and run the Python script.
    ```bash
    cd analysis
    python analyze.py
    ```
